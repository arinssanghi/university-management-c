Introduction

I will begin with a brief introduction about this project and the different stages of the design and the development of UNIVERSITY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM. Before detailed discussion, first of all I would like to give an overall idea about this project.

TITLE OF THE PROJECT 

“UNIVERSITY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM”

I developed my project on UNIVERSITY MANGEMNET SYSTEM, because University System is one of the most common and the first application implemented in any higher educational organization.

	In University a large amount of data is processed and the results are used in running an organization. The University management system project maintains the list of colleges and their different streams. It also maintains the examination and the result department with a proper menu system.

The main goal of the project is to obtain the complete and correct information. Because University management department of an organization maintains a record of:
•	The Colleges
•	The Students 
•	The Examination & Result 

To do that, the department:
•	Prepares the record for each department, showing the total number of student and colleges.
•	Keeps track of any modification necessary related to the students and colleges.
•	Produces regular reports for the Organization giving the total information required.

Management needs to know details like department – number of colleges, their streams, the degree courses run by them and location. Management also needs to know the same information about the students.
