Introduction

I will begin with a brief introduction about this project and the different stages of the design and the development of UNIVERSITY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM. Before detailed discussion, first of all I would like to give an overall idea about this project.

TITLE OF THE PROJECT 

“UNIVERSITY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM”

I developed my project on UNIVERSITY MANGEMNET SYSTEM, because University System is one of the most common and the first application implemented in any higher educational organization.

	In University a large amount of data is processed and the results are used in running an organization. The University management system project maintains the list of colleges and their different streams. It also maintains the examination and the result department with a proper menu system.
